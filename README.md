REPORT
1.	Overview of Election Audit: Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis.
The purpose of the election audit analysis was to combine coding techniques such as for loops, conditional statements, and logical operators, in order to emulate the analysis done for candidates by counties instead – this entailed figuring out the number of votes per county, the percentage of total votes per county, and ultimately the county with the greatest voter turnout.



2.	Election-Audit Results: Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.
o	How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
There were a total of 369,711 votes cast in this congressional election.
o	Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
Jefferson County had 38,855 votes, which made up 10.5% of the total number of votes. Denver County had 306,055 votes, which made up 82.8% of the total number of votes. Arapahoe County had 24,801 votes, which made up 6.7% of the total number of votes.
o	Which county had the largest number of votes?
Denver County had the largest number of votes.
o	Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
Charles Casper Stockham received 85,213 votes, which made up 23.0% of the total number of votes. Diana DeGette received 272,892 votes, which made up 73.8% of the total number of votes. Raymon Anthony Doane received 11,606 votes, which made up 3.1% of the total number of votes.
o	Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
Diana DeGette won the election with 73.8% of the votes for a total of 272,892 votes.



3.	Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
If the election commission were to conduct surveys and acquire a sufficient amount of data about voters from any precinct in a different election, we could then conduct all sorts of analyses in a variety of different ways. For example, the commission might have collected data about voters’ income, ethnicity, and political party affiliation. In that case, the options are as follows:
We could conduct a similar analysis about income data and determine the number and percentage of votes for each socioeconomic class.
We could conduct a similar analysis about ethnicity data and determine the number and percentage of votes for each ethnic group.
We could conduct a similar analysis about affiliation data and determine the number and percentage of votes for each political party.
